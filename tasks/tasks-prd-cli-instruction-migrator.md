- `internal/core/migrator_test.go` - Unit tests for migrator logic.
- `internal/config/config.go` - Handles configuration management (storage location, etc.).
- `internal/config/config_test.go` - Unit tests for configuration management.
- `internal/validation/validator.go` - Validates Markdown instruction files against required schema.
- `internal/validation/validator_test.go` - Unit tests for file validation logic.

### Notes

- Unit tests should typically be placed alongside the code files they are testing (e.g., `fileviewer.go` and `fileviewer_test.go` in the same directory).
- Use `go test ./...` to run all tests in the project.
- Use `task` to run all local development commands (see README.md for details).
